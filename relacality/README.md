# Relacality

A playable ontological piano and temporal relational reasoning game for Ontological Worlds. There are **27 permanently assigned keys**: nine archetypal forms, nine inner forms, and nine outer forms. Six independently configurable metronomes provide optional accompaniment.

## Play

Open **PROTOTYPE: Relacality** on the Ontological Worlds main screen, or open [this repository’s hosted app](https://mike-stack1982364.github.io/Ontological-Worlds/relacality/index.html) in a current browser. This is a complete independent copy maintained in this directory, with no external runtime assets, upstream repository connection or automatic updates. Settings, notes and recordings use the `ontological-worlds.relacality.*` browser-storage namespace; they are separate from the main games. A key press or a transport button enables audio. No sign-in, microphone permission, external audio service, or account is needed.

For local development, run `npm start` from this `relacality/` directory (Node and Python 3 installed) and open `http://localhost:4173`. This is a static ES-module application; serve it over HTTP rather than opening `index.html` as a local file.

For a single-file offline version, download [`offline/relacality.html`](offline/relacality.html) and open it directly in a current browser; no server, installation or internet connection is needed to play. You can move or rename that HTML file. It contains the complete interface, styles, ontology and audio/game engines. Browser storage for local files varies by browser, so export recordings you want to keep. To rebuild after changing the source files, run `npm run build:standalone` with Node 22 or newer.

## The 27 keys

| Category | Archetypal | Inner | Outer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All | Q | A | Z |
| Difference | W | S | X |
| Action | E | D | C |
| Division | R | F | V |
| Connection | T | G | B |
| Multiplication / Unfoldment | Y | H | N |
| Projection | U | J | M |
| Encompassment | I | K | , |
| Completion | O | L | . |

These are physical keyboard positions. Every form also has its own touch pad, pitch, name and definition. Keyboard playing is suspended while typing into a form field. Hold a key to sustain it; release to end it. Escape releases notes and cancels a performance or replay.

Category, perspective, entity and timing remain distinct. These ontology meanings are a vocabulary for constructing imagined worlds; musical intervals do not automatically establish causal relationships.

### Full rows, all notes and custom chords

Hold **1** for all nine archetypal notes (Q–O), **2** for all nine inner notes (A–L), **3** for all nine outer notes (Z–.), or **4** for all **27** notes together. The number pad also works. The four buttons above the piano support the same hold-and-release action with a mouse or touch; a focused button also supports holding Enter or Space. Each chord starts with one shared audio onset and records one shared onset time.

Turn on **Latch individual keys** to build a custom chord one key at a time. Tap a note to keep it held, and tap again to release it. Row shortcuts and buttons remain momentary. Switching latch off releases latched notes while preserving notes you are still physically holding. **Escape** or **Release notes** releases everything. The counter shows the number of distinct held notes; overlapping row, key, pointer and latch inputs share each pitch instead of doubling it. Notes stop only when their last input releases them. Focus loss and hiding the page also clear every hold.

All 27 reported key presses are supported directly. Some keyboards cannot report large simultaneous combinations because of hardware or protocol rollover; a web page cannot recover key presses it never receives. The number shortcuts, on-screen row controls and latch mode work around this restriction. They do not alter the physical keyboard's rollover capability. The first row includes **O** as its ninth key.

## Three modes

- **Free play:** improvise with all 27 keys, with or without accompaniment. Record up to three minutes of key presses and held durations, replay the phrase, and export it as JSON. Recordings, world notes and settings remain in the current browser.
- **Reason & play:** infer a missing event time from explicit premises, then perform the revealed phrase. Levels cover order and delay, overlapping intervals, and nested intervals. A four-beat count-in precedes beat 0. Performance pace follows Clock 1's BPM, even when that clock is disabled. Enabled clocks accompany the performance. Results distinguish correct keys, onset timing and required holds.
- **World match:** compare complete temporal worlds with repeated entities and multiple aspects. One consistent entity renaming must preserve category, perspective, role attachments, relative onset times and durations. A uniform positive time scaling and a common start-time shift are ignored. Close nonmatches swap entity attachments, alter a perspective, or move only one event. The labelled score carries entity identities; audio alone does not encode them.

Da Vinci prompts invite constructing one coherent world, expressing its structure in a distant domain, and predicting what a changed relationship would alter. These open-ended constructions are not automatically graded. Scores measure the displayed practice task and are not intelligence scores.

## Six independent clocks

Each clock has:

- **1–240 BPM**, in whole beats per minute.
- **1–16 beats per bar**, including odd, even and single-beat metres.
- One of six sounds: Wood, Bell, Click, Rim, Glass or Pulse.
- An independent volume and start offset of 0–16 beats (quarter-beat steps in the UI).
- A per-beat pattern: normal, accent or silent. A silent beat keeps its time slot.
- A separate enable switch. All six may run together, or all may be switched off.

All clocks share the transport start but maintain independent tempi. The 3-against-2 preset uses 90 and 60 BPM with three- and two-beat bars, so their bar starts coincide. Other presets cover 5-against-4, nested tempi and six synchronized bar lengths.

The global cue setting supports continuous sound, visual-only timing, and four audible bars followed by four silent bars **independently for each clock**. Key sound has a separate switch. Pause preserves elapsed time and phase; Stop resets to zero. Hiding or leaving the page pauses the clocks and cancels an active practice attempt.

## Audio and measurement

Audio is locally synthesized using Web Audio. The piano has a short attack, decaying harmonics and a quiet sustain until release. A one-hour safety ceiling applies to a single held or scheduled note. Up to 32 simultaneous piano voices are supported, allowing all 27 instrument keys together. When capacity is needed, released tails and scheduled voices yield before held live keys. Actual hardware key rollover may impose a lower limit on physical keyboard chords; use the full-row shortcuts or latch mode in that case. Touch input has independent pointer handling.

Once audio is running, a key press starts its note synchronously, before display or recording updates. Live notes have no added scheduling delay and a 1.5 ms attack. A memoryless soft limiter bounds dense chords without a compressor's lookahead buffer. The browser is asked for interactive audio latency; its actual output buffer and device remain outside the game's control.

Metronomes are scheduled against `AudioContext.currentTime` with lookahead. Event times are calculated from an epoch instead of accumulating timer intervals. Late background beats are skipped rather than emitted as a burst. Recording replay uses a rolling scheduling window. Pause, stop and cancellation release queued audio.

Metronome visuals, replay highlights and practice timing follow estimated audible time using `getOutputTimestamp()` when valid, with reported `baseLatency` / `outputLatency` as a fallback. Audio scheduling itself stays on the render clock. The interface reports the browser's available output-delay estimate; that estimate may omit input, Bluetooth and other hardware delays. It is not an end-to-end latency measurement. Built-in speakers or wired headphones are preferable when wireless audio feels late. Software cannot make a newly pressed note reach a slow output device instantly, and notes are never quantized to hide a mistimed press.

Timing feedback describes key input against the estimated audible beat. It is useful practice feedback, not calibrated laboratory measurement. The standard onset/hold tolerance is ±0.25 beats. Incorrect, missing and additional notes affect the scores. No audio is recorded from a microphone.

## Checks

`npm test` runs the pure engine and scheduling regressions with Node 22 or newer. `node tests/browser.mjs` runs the browser checks when Playwright and Chromium are installed. The browser test uses `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` when provided and supports the Codex primary runtime's Playwright installation.

The test suite checks category/key uniqueness, generated deductions, full-world matching, score behaviour, all six clock voices, extreme tempi, odd/even patterns, cancellation, silent bars and sustained notes. Browser checks cover keyboard and touch input, transport, recording, game flows and responsive layout.
